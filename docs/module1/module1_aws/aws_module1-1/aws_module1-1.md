# Module 1.1 - Launch NeuralSeek

## Log in

Log in to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/home" target="_blank">AWS Console Marketplace page</a>.

![image1.1.1](images/image1.1.1.png)

Click the yellow "Manage subscriptions" button.

## Discover products

‚ö†Ô∏è If you already have subscribed to NeuralSeek, you do not have to do these steps. Please move to the `Manage subscriptions` section and continue.

On the left side menu, click "Discover products".

In the "Search AWS Marketplace products" enter `NeuralSeek` and press enter. You will see two products in the search result:

![image1.1.1.1](images/image1.1.1.1.png)

### Selecting the product

If you do not have access to your own large language model (LLM), you may choose the first one which is `NeuralSeek`, which does provide our curated LLM included in it.

If you do have your own LLM, and thus have the necessary keys and region, (role access key, secret access key, and region) you can choose `NeuralSeek - Bring Your Own Large Language Model`.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that these NeuralSeek subscriptions, when created, will incur billing and cost as they are used.

## Purchasing

After you selected a product from the list, click "View purchase options" button at the top right.

Review the offer, and pricing information. When ready click `Subscribe` button under the "Purchase".

## Manage Subscriptions

Go back to your <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/home#/subscriptions" target="_blank">Manage subscriptions</a> page.

You may either have `NeuralSeek` or `NeuralSeek - Bring Your Own Large Language Model` depending on what you chose to subscribe for the lab.
