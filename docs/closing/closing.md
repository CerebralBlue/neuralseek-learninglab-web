# Finishing and closing the lab
After the lab is finished, it is important to make sure that the subscriptions and instances would be deleted so that any unexpected usage cost does not incur. Failing to do so may result in unnecessary billing to occur, so it is highly recommended that you would clean up the created resources after you are finished.
