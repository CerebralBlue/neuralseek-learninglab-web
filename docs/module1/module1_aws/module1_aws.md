# Module 1 - AWS

The goal of **Module 1 - AWS** of the Learning Lab is to provide users with the essential steps on how to effectively incorporate NeuralSeek's advanced conversational capabilities into a current AWS environment. By the end of this module, users will have a solid understanding of the steps involved in provisioning NeuralSeek, integrating it seamlessly with an AWS Kendra instance, and setting up a seamless integration with an AWS Lex virtual agent. By leveraging the combined power of NeuralSeek and AWS's pioneering technology, prepare to enhance your technical expertise and optimize customer engagement strategies.

# Disclaimer 

Before participating in this Learning Lab, it is essential that users come prepared with the necessary resources to fully engage in the practical exercises. We recommend having an active instance of an:

- **Large Language Model (LLM)**, we recommend the Amazon Bedrock LLM "**Claude 2.**".
- **KnowledgeBase**, we recommend the AWS KnowledgeBase "**Kendra Index.**". Optionally you can also try using **Elastic AppSearch**.
- **Virtual Agent**, we recommend the AWS Virtual Agent "**LexV2 Lambda.**"
- **Active NeuralSeek subscription**. If you do not already have an active subscription, we will go through creating one during the lab.

⚠️ Please be aware that any purchases or subscriptions related to the aforementioned tools must be made independently by the users. Additionally, to access NeuralSeek functionalities within the lab, users are required to have an active subscription to NeuralSeek on the AWS Marketplace. It is the responsibility of each participant to understand and manage the associated costs related to the use of NeuralSeek and any other integrated services within their AWS environment. Kindly ensure that all necessary resources are set up and accessible prior to beginning the Learning Lab for a seamless and enriching experience.
