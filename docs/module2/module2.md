# Module 2: Using NeuralSeek

Welcome to the Learning Lab, a platform dedicated to empowering you in the seamless integration of NeuralSeek with your selected knowledge base and virtual agent. Throughout this lab, you will learn to harness NeuralSeek's sophisticated AI capabilities, which will elevate your virtual agent to the forefront of natural language generation. We will fine-tune AI-generated answers using the tools and metrics on the NeuralSeek user interface and go through step-by-step integration of NeuralSeek with a knowledge base. By seamlessly incorporating NeuralSeek, you'll discover how to ensure that your virtual agent's responses not only uphold accuracy but also amplify scalability, all while retaining the essential element of human oversight. Unlock the full potential of AI with no code, minimal effort and all the necessary enterprise functionality and security.

The purpose of **Module 2: Using NeuralSeek**  is to highlight the key features of NeuralSeek that are instrumental in training virtual agents, including customer-facing chatbots and Natural Language Processing systems. These features not only facilitate natural language responses but also ensure the prevention of hallucinated outputs, automate language translation processes, and protect user's private identifying information. Recognizing that the quality of generated AI responses hinges on the integrity of the underlying data, the tools featured in this module intentionally provide resources for human oversight to prevent errors and avoid biases.
