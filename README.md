# Welcome to NeuralSeek Learning Lab

## IBM related lab information
### IBM Watson Discovery
Watson discovery contains the web crawled collection of documentation found in https://documentation.neuralseek.com.

## AWS related lab information
### AWS Kendra
During the AWS learning lab, lab participants are required to setup NeuralSeek with a knowledgebase. Creating their own Knowledgebase and adding documents to use it during the lab is impossible, as those would take close to hours. Therefore, When using learning lab, we do provide access to a Kendra Index which is pre-populated with information.

These information are crawled website information of https://documentation.neuralseek.com.
