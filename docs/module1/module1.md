# Module 1: Inital Setup of NeuralSeek - No Code Required

Welcome to the Learning Lab, a platform dedicated to empowering you in the seamless integration of NeuralSeek with your selected knowledge base and virtual agent. Throughout this lab, you will learn to harness NeuralSeek's sophisticated AI capabilities, which will elevate your virtual agent to the forefront of natural language generation. We will fine-tune AI-generated answers using the tools and metrics on the NeuralSeek user interface and go through step-by-step integration of NeuralSeek with a knowledge base. By seamlessly incorporating NeuralSeek, you'll discover how to ensure that your virtual agent's responses not only uphold accuracy but also amplify scalability, all while retaining the essential element of human oversight. Unlock the full potential of AI with no code, minimal effort and all the necessary enterprise functionality and security.

The purpose of **Module 1: Initial Setup of NeuralSeek - No Code Required** is to authenticate and connect NeuralSeek with a KnowledgeBase and a Virtual Agent.
